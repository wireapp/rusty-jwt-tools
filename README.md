## Parts

* acme: types that deal with ACME certificate enrollment
* e2e-identity: implementation of the Wire end-to-end identity workflow, built on top of acme and jwt
* ffi: Haskell bindings for rusty-jwt-tools, only used by wire-server
* jwt: a collection of JWT utilities
* x509-check: helpers for X509 certificate validation, only used by acme

## Building

For the build requirements, look at [the information in core-crypto repo](
https://github.com/wireapp/core-crypto?tab=readme-ov-file#general-requirements).

> [!note]
> Building rusty-jwt-tools independently of core-crypto for Android targets is currently not supported due to
> missing configuration bits. However, the necessary bits are in core-crypto so one can build rusty-jwt-tools
> for Android targets as part of a core-crypto build.

Building is as simple as
```bash
cargo build
```

## Testing

Install cargo-nextest if you haven't done so, it yields some substantial speedup.
Also, it allows us to group tests easily and have custom settings for those groups (see [`.config/nextest.toml`](.config/nextest.toml)).

```bash
cargo install cargo-nextest
```

Make sure the docker daemon is running (this is needed because the test suite runs an OIDC provider
inside a container).

Run tests:
```bash
cargo nextest run
```

### Testing the Haskell FFI

Make sure you have [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) installed.

Then run:
```bash
cd ffi
cargo make hs-test
```

## Git workflow

See [core-crypto git workflow](https://github.com/wireapp/core-crypto?tab=readme-ov-file#git-workflow).

## Publishing

No crates are published on crates.io or any other Rust crate registry.
The only release artifacts are source archives on github.

### Versioning

The versioning scheme used is [SemVer AKA Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

### Making a new release

1. Make a branch based on `main` to prepare for release (`git checkout -b prepare-release/X.Y.Z`)
1. Update the version of all workspace members to `X.Y.Z`, including places that refer to them.
1. Generate a fresh `e2e-identity/README.md.test`:
   ```
    cargo test --package wire-e2e-identity --test e2e demo_should_succeed
   ```
   If there are non-trivial differences between `e2e-identity/README.md` and the generated file,
   update `e2e-identity/README.md` and commit the changes.
1. Generate the relevant changelog section:
   ```
   git cliff --bump --unreleased
   ```
   and add it to the top of `CHANGELOG.md`.
   Make sure the version number generated by `git cliff` matches the release version.
1. If there are any release highlights, add them as the first subsection below release title:
   ```markdown
   ## v0.10.0 - 2024-05-02

   ### Highlights

   - foo
   - bar
   - baz
   ```
1. Push your `prepare-release/X.Y.Z` branch and create a PR for it
1. Get it reviewed, then merge it into `main` and remove the `prepare-release/X.Y.Z` branch from the remote
1. Now, pull your local `main`: `git checkout main && git pull`
1. Create the release tag: `git tag -s vX.Y.Z`
1. Push the new tag: `git push origin tag vX.Y.Z`
1. Create a new release on github, copying the relevant section from `CHANGELOG.md`
1. Voil√†!
