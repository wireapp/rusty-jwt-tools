# ? Ring treats warnings as errors during local development by detecting
# ? the presence of a `.git` folder
# ? With us having a git dependency to ring, this triggers this local development behavior, preventing
# ? release builds on certain platforms. Gotta love build systems that are "UB as a service"
# TODO: Remove this once we target a crates.io version of ring. Probably never!
